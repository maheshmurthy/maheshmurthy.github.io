Hello! I am Mahesh Murthy, a technologist living in Boston. For past few years, I have been all in on blockchain. I am currently working on www.boringcrypto.xyz. I have created a few blockchain courses at www.zastrin.com. I was formerly CTO of Nextgengolf, Inc (acquired by PGA of America). I love my family, food, travel, technology and startups.
