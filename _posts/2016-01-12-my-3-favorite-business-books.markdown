I had not read any business/management books till now. In the last one year, I have read these three books and really liked all of them. I highly recommend it for any noobs like me.

1. [Creativity Inc](http://amzn.to/1JGHOFr "Creativity Inc")

2. [Hard things about hard things](http://amzn.to/1TR1sir "Hard things about hard things")

3. [High output management](http://amzn.to/1TR1CX2 "High output management")
